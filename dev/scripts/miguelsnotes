react is one-directional

passing down things

<lighthouse color ="blue"/>
    <lighthouse>
<lighthouse>

<div> (lighthouse)
    <p>{this.props.color}<p>
<div>

everythings an object

Child: what is the correct version of me


1. Do I have state?
the component 
if yes/ its complext component
if no/ its simple component

2. Does it have super on it?



1 JS file returns 1 component




look up vue.js



1. all state is, is an object
2. state is scoped to the component
3. when state is changed, renders() happen


React-routing

1. Folders / 2.Funnels

Funnels 
top(/index.html)
middle(/cups)
bottom(/cups/teacups)

debugger shows what's been deleted and what's been populated

console.trace();
it will print you a list of how it got there.
